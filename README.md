This repository contains my project from the Gen AI internship with IBM.
## IBM GenAI Internship Project

During my internship at IBM, I focused on leveraging Generative AI tools to automate the creation of presentation slides. The project involved the following key components:

1. **Content Generation with ChatGPT**: I used ChatGPT to generate comprehensive and engaging content for each slide. By crafting specific prompts, I was able to create detailed text and insights for the presentation.

2. **Image Creation with Copilot**: To complement the textual content, I utilized Copilot to generate relevant and high-quality images. These visuals enhanced the overall appeal and effectiveness of the presentation.

3. **Presentation Assembly with Google Slides**: I integrated the generated content and images into Google Slides to create a polished and cohesive presentation. This platform allowed for easy customization and collaboration.

This project showcases the practical application of Generative AI in streamlining the process of creating professional presentations. The combination of ChatGPT, Copilot, and Google Slides demonstrates the potential of AI to revolutionize content creation and design.
